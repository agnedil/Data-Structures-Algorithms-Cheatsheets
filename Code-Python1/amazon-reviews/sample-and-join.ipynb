Unfortunately, Weigel has obviously not spent much time with any of the writings of the Church prior to Vatican II or any pope prior to John Paul II.  I have no problem with  either Vatican II, or Blessed John Paul II, but there WAS a church prior to both of them, and Weigel would be well served to explore it.The real issue is one that is underlying and one that Weigel seems to hint at, but will not engage with.  It is the issue of what is the true nature of the Church and what is her level of necessity when it comes to salvation.  Weigel, unfortunately, seems to subscribe to the general consensus among the laity and all too many of the clerics in the Church that there is nothing truly special about the Bride of Christ, and that one is just as likely ...</td>\n",

The characters (the two children - one complete with teddy bear, the vain celebrity, a boisterous agent) could easily have been written by Agatha Christie or Ngaio Marsh. The countryside setting (a forgotten chapel in a forlorn English seaside town) is also a throwback to the golden age of English cottage mysteries.But Ms. Atherton has her characters living in the present time (complete with mobile phone and lap top computers) but this does nothing to diminish the quaint feeling I got reading THE DUKE.If you enjoy intelligently written and plotted mysteries, I heartily recommend Ms. Atherton's AUNT DIMITY entries.</td>\n",

He has it in his mind that this is all because she has some feelings for Tony. I'm sorry but Alec is a jerk. If he really knew his girlfriend ,the way he thought he did, then he would know that she would do anything to help others. Especially those she cares about. Tsk. Tsk. Alec. He breaks up with her.

The secondary characters were vibrant and I must say I loved Jamie's portrayal as Theresa's best friend. The only thing I didn't like was the clear ignorance in regards to Rhea's phallus obsession and inappropriate comments. Sure she probably learned it from the adults around her, and it might have even been funny for a while, but eventually that foul mouth should've been checked. Clearly it only progressed when she became a teen.I think the romance between Theresa and Nathaniel was done right, it didn't feel forced or too much like a romance novel.

The first 2-3 times this is related is fine and lets the reader know that there's chemistry between the two characters.  After that, you can make it a drinking game as to the number of times Folsom has to write that Triton is aroused.  We get it.As for Sophia, she's likeable enough, but not that interesting of a heroine.  I like female characters to have some backbone and fire.  Sophia just seems to muddle through the story, letting others guide her fate rather than taking control of her own life.

       "038573901X  I enjoy a great romance novel now and again, and I like it when there are relationships in most of the YA books that I read. But the key word for me is romance, not just hormones and sex. I felt like Ari, who is too good to be true in many aspects, was a little too fixated on boys in this book between her long-standing crush on her brother-in-law, her ennui over her ex-boyfriend, her interactions with Del, and her relationship with Blake. While I remember being 17 and dealing with those crazy teenage hormones, that in and of itself isn't altogether that interesting to read about. At least not the way it's done here.There are a few conversations between Ari and Blake about what they want in the future, but overall I felt like most of the book was about her wanting a boyfriend and her boy troubles, with the occasional friend, family, and SAT drama tossed in. I'd be okay with a book that was all about a relationship if there was more joy or depth or caring to it (see Sixteenth Summer ...   \n",

What I Want wraps up the Stranded series. It ties up the story, while leaving room for another story at a later date.I adore Drake and Ashley. In What I want, we get to see into Drake's head, experience what he was thinking and feeling back in the cabin and since. I love seeing how Ashley is realizing that what she wants may not be what is best for her. It's a tough place to be in.  Noelle Stevens did a great job portraying how vulnerable and strong Ashley is.  Emily is also more involved in the story and is a much needed voice of reason.   \n",
       "0465027687  Weigel's entire premise rests on the idea that we are in some sort of 500 year change in the world, and that the Church in order to be relevant, needs to properly identify this change so that we can reestablish our evangelical roots.  Unfortunately, Weigel has obviously not spent much time with any of the writings of the Church prior to Vatican II or any pope prior to John Paul II.  I have no problem with  either Vatican II, or Blessed John Paul II, but there WAS a church prior to both of them, and Weigel would be well served to explore it.The real issue is one that is underlying and one that Weigel seems to hint at, but will not engage with.  It is the issue of what is the true nature of the Church and what is her level of necessity when it comes to salvation.  Weigel, unfortunately, seems to subscribe to the general consensus among the laity and all too many of the clerics in the Church that there is nothing truly special about the Bride of Christ, and that one is just as likely ...   \n",

This is one of the best books I've read for the storyline in a long time! It starts off easy, flight attendent has a crush on co-pilot who just happens to be her best friend's step brother. Nina, the flight attendent, and Liam, the co-pilot. Nina has an alter-ego that likes to shake it up after a long flight, she seeks a salsa dance floor to get rid of her frustrations. Enter the 'other guy'.  Believe me when I say that this book totally took me by surprise! When the plot finally is untwisted, its unreal how twisted it actually is. To say I enjoyed this book is an understatement. The sex is hot, the love is intense and the twists are like hairpin curves. Take a chance with this book, it doesn't get bogged down, it moves right along. Be prepared for the surprise, and its not even at the end!   \n",

       "0547490801  While I can appreciate the symbolism and attention to historical detail something was sorely lacking with Accidents of Providence. Sadly, I struggled with this title reading a few pages at a time and thinking to myself, maybe I should read something else.The book seemed to ramble and repeat each chapter and the only breakup of the monotony are tossed in unexpected lust scenes, which at times were more ridiculous and laughable than anything. The romance and magnetism between characters didn't seem believable. The characters were a little flat and not one could be considered enjoyable. Finally, exciting events or any buildup had this annoying habit to abruptly stop because of some silly almost gimmicky cause.*The ending was totally unbelievable, however, believe it or not after doing some research it is based on actual truth! Research (after you read the book, otherwise you will spoil the shock of a miracle in medical history) the story of a maid servant named Anne Greene in the 1600...   \n",

       "0992106834  Being the daughter of a big-city mayor, twenty-one year old Skye Summers has giant shoes to fill in her first real job out of college. In book 1 (snarky attitude here; read it, I hate when they say it is a stand a lone, yes it is but why miss it?) We get a glimpse of  Skye and her boyfriend. We sort of get the clue he is controlling, but this books clears all that up. The author shows a controlling, ego driven man. Vic is just a tad short of being abusive physically towards Skye. It doesn't go too deep into it until he resurfaces.  This book shows the old characters from book 1 and how they have progressed. I loved Skye and how politically savvy she is. He parents have expectations of her and she tries to live up to it. One thing I will say is that I ordinarily would hate her Dad and his senate race, but...I loved him. He was not at all the person I thought he would be. He has unconditional love for his daughter and doesn't even stutter when she makes a small error. I expected ted ...   \n",

Contrary to the negative reviews, I thought the author did a great job telling the story.  I did read the WWII part of the book first, but then I read the whole thing from the beginning and enjoyed it immensely.  This book fits in well with The Rape of Europa, both DVD and book, if you're drawn to the broader topic of plundered art.  There's a lot of solid research here, some of it quite amazing, and the writer's style is enjoyable to read, not overly academic.  I really liked the book, and will soon check online about the 2010 cleaning funded by the Getty Trust to see if the dangling mystery of the one panel is finally resolved.   \n",

The characters (the two children - one complete with teddy bear, the vain celebrity, a boisterous agent) could easily have been written by Agatha Christie or Ngaio Marsh. The countryside setting (a forgotten chapel in a forlorn English seaside town) is also a throwback to the golden age of English cottage mysteries.But Ms. Atherton has her characters living in the present time (complete with mobile phone and lap top computers) but this does nothing to diminish the quaint feeling I got reading THE DUKE.If you enjoy intelligently written and plotted mysteries, I heartily recommend Ms. Atherton's AUNT DIMITY entries.   \n",

       "0439110157  Poor little Gus and his dog, Button, live in a drab, brown mushroom world.  One day a great wind comes up, and blows a bright green &quot;something&quot; by their window.  Color!  Gus is so curious and intrigued, that he and Button decide to venture out into the cold, harsh world, and find out where this beautiful green thing came from.  So off they go on the journey of a lifetime, through the dangerous Howling Forest to see who and what lives on the other side.....  Saxton Freymann and Joost Elffers are playing with their food again, and have filled this inventive story with color, imagery and magic.  Their simple, rhyming text is kept to a minimum.  The real story is told in their amazing and innovative illustrations.  Scores of fruits and vegetables come to life as people, places, and things, and dance creatively through these pages as artichoke trees, friendly apples, oranges and peppers, mushroom people, watermelon boats, red cabbage rivers, and much, much more.

I love to cook and am a long-time vegetarian, but I've not found a good Indian cookbook and have little to no experience cooking Indian foods.Unfortunately, I just haven't had a good experience with the recipes in this book.  Most of them seem to use the same set of spices (hence, very similar tastes no matter what you make).  I guess the recipes turned out OK, but not a winner.  I thought this would allow me to make restaurant-quality Indian food (as it did for another reviewer), but it didn't.  Just more fair-quality food.  I liked one recipe with spinach and lentils but couldn't find a recipe for Naan, my chipatis didn't poof up like the recipe said they should, another lentil dish was rejected by my kids. You might be more experienced with Indian food and have better luck, but this cookbook was a disappointment for me.   \n",
       "0425089517  I purchased \"Tunnels\" to serve as historical background reading for a recent trip to Cu Chi, and was suprised to find such an informative source.  Mangold and Penycate refrain from the usual Western bias that often plagues the Vietnam paperback genere and instead have created a very well researched and objective study of Cu Chi province and its unique history.Most of the research is composed of countless interviews with American military personel, coupled with very enlightening interviews with NLF leaders and guerrillas. Aside from simply providing military analysis, the authors dig into the history, culture and society of Vietnam, which lends to an interesting \"sociological and historical context\" to the creation of the Cu Chi Tunnels and the incrediable endurance of the Vietnamese people.Most interesting were the views of the Vietnamese fighting and surviving in the tunnels - enduring the full wrath of American military might being unleashed a few shallow meters above their heads...   \n",

The Beloved One is a riveting, poignant, historical romance that I will never forget.  What an imagination.  What a writer! The characters have depth.  The storyline is like no other I've read.  It is definitely a keeper!  Now, I'm buying book 3.   \n",

       "B00AMQEFNA  This book seems to center more around Willow and Tony's world than anyone else. So for those Tony fans (Me!!!) you will be happy that he gets more face time. Willow sets out to save her parents and Tony. Willow being Willow her first priority is not herself but others. She wants to bring Tony and her parents back safe. Alec doesn't understand. He has it in his mind that this is all because she has some feelings for Tony. I'm sorry but Alec is a jerk. If he really knew his girlfriend ,the way he thought he did, then he would know that she would do anything to help others. Especially those she cares about. Tsk. Tsk. Alec. He breaks up with her. Yes! There is hope for Tony. But not so fast Tony fans. When she does find Tony something has happened that has changed him. At first you think is a Reaper because his eyes turn red. Willow heals him though, only temporarily. We find out later that it is all connected to Zack because of the shot he gave him. Is he Reaper? I don't think so but ...   \n",
       "1938623320  The second to last page in the epilogue, oh goodness, my eyes couldn't read fast enough. Way to play at my emotions Ms. Stunich. And speaking of emotions, this book hit upon a lot of them. Humor being at the forefront.I loved the characters, each of them felt important and unique. The secondary characters were vibrant and I must say I loved Jamie's portrayal as Theresa's best friend. The only thing I didn't like was the clear ignorance in regards to Rhea's phallus obsession and inappropriate comments. Sure she probably learned it from the adults around her, and it might have even been funny for a while, but eventually that foul mouth should've been checked. Clearly it only progressed when she became a teen.I think the romance between Theresa and Nathaniel was done right, it didn't feel forced or too much like a romance novel. It felt believable to me especially accounting for the fact that both of the were seriously damaged. The novel packed just the right amount on tasteful steam,...   \n",

       "0985804602  I really was intrigued by the blurb of this book and immediately bought the ePub version of it on Smashwords when it came out. And the storyline IS really intriguing, which is the only reason I kept reading this book past the first few chapters, because there's just too much of an info-dump going on here. I mean, the first two chapters have NO dialogue at all. None. It's just descriptions of what Alessa has already went through before the story actually starts. Even seeing 'her' ghost for the first time is described in the past perfect tense. We're not there the moment it happens. That just doesn't make sense... like this, the supposed mystery doesn't draw the reader in, because there's no excitement, no emotions, no surprise, no nothing... it has already happened and we weren't witness to it.But of course, the plot is intriguing so I kept reading to find out what would happen next.

Some a whole lot higher than others.When Mia Turner receives word that brother has been kidnapped while on an expedition in Mexico, she receives explicit directions not try to find him but she does.  That was her first mistake her second was seeking out King to help find him because the price he wants to find her brother isn&#8217;t money, but Mia herself.  She now belongs to King and when he seems to know things that he should never know, she&#8217;s questioning what he is as well as how far he will go to make certain that she does as she&#8217;s told.This book does end on a cliffhanger as many of Mimi&#8217;s books do but the next book is already out so don&#8217;t fret.  I&#8217;ve already bought book 2 and am in hopes that we find out exactly King is.  I don&#8217;t believe that he is the Devil as Mia suspects but I do feel that he has to be supernatural in some way.  A very intriguing...   \n",

I found a few slight errors, including the following sentence:  \"'Ansel assures me that I'll feel much more the thing if I get some fresh air' Addie Easton said...\".  I have no idea what that was supposed to say!  But the plot kept me interested, although it did go into what seem to be the obligatory details of the steamy sex scenes that some novelists like to write about, but which I always skip over.  I would recommend this book, which is based on a true incident but the story is fiction.   \n",
       "1456307185  I had high hopes for this book; I love Greek mythology and the idea of Greek gods living today and interacting with humans was appealing.  However, Folsom's idea of character development is to make sure the reader knows that the male protagonist, Triton, is constantly physically aroused by the female protagonist, Sophia.  The first 2-3 times this is related is fine and lets the reader know that there's chemistry between the two characters.  After that, you can make it a drinking game as to the number of times Folsom has to write that Triton is aroused.  We get it.As for Sophia, she's likeable enough, but not that interesting of a heroine.  I like female characters to have some backbone and fire.  Sophia just seems to muddle through the story, letting others guide her fate rather than taking control of her own life.  Granted, her condition creates a need for her others to help her, but despite Triton's claim that Sophia is courageous and strong, I don't see it.There were some well-w...   \n",

       "1595553207  I was recently given the chance through Booksneeze to review a digital copy Daddy Dates, by Greg Wright.  I think this is an awesome, down-to-earth, easy read book that every father of daughters should read.  The concept he presents is simple, and offers lots of ideas on how to implement this idea, but the payoff is extraordinary!I love the idea of chasing after your daughters...learning about their desires, fears, their hearts...and helping them learn how unique, how special God made them, so they will know even better how to make wise choices in the future (relationships, etc.)I know to my daughter, Daddy is everything to her.  She's only 4 right now.  But I can't wait to implement these ideas within their relationship, that will help keep them as close years from now as they are now...so she wants to run and tell Daddy things...and learn from him.  I would love to purchase more copies of this for my husband and others in my family to read and pass on!I definitely recommend this ...   \n",

       "1440552703  Amazon doesn't allow half-stars, so I rounded up, but my criticisms are very mild. Basically, this is a really good book that should definitely appeal to its target audience. It has a decent insight into the teenage mind and provides wish fulfillment, from kids outwitting dangerous adults to matching up an ordinary teenage girl with a rock star. It also covers such ubiquitous adolescent angst as being ostracized by former friends. The plot is not complex. I knew who the bad guy was within the first few pages. But it's a suspenseful read with some horror, and goes at breakneck pace. All the action takes place in less than one weekend. A bunch of kids from the upper class of a ritzy town gather for a birthday party that will last all weekend. The birthday girl has been through some trauma in the past, and her father is eager to provide a wonderful event to raise her spirits, going as far as hiring a popular rock singer to perform. Ariel's former best friend, Sera, is now the outcast ...   \n",
