    " \n",
    "- in the worst case scenario, we have a time complexity of\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- the space complexity is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " - a list of orders for each active courier - O(N)\n",
    " \n",
    " - a list of couriers - O(N)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things that can go wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "- a courier may decide to leave with a non-empty delivery list, in which case we must re-assign those orders\n",
    "\n",
    " - we could just re-add those order into the stream, as if they were new orders\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we compare this algorithm to a processor that has to process tasks, each courier would be a processor with a **single-core and no multiprocessing capabilities**, i.e. it can't have two orders concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    " - This means that each courier can't *interleave* orders (as a processor switches between processes that are doing slow tasks such as reading from disk) a courier will sit idle for a long time if we have a time-constrained order where the delivery time is hours or days after the pickup time.\n",
    " \n",
    " - One solution for this is, naturally, to allow each courier (core) to process multiple orders (processes) at the same time, keeping the packages (process context) in memory. We could use the same scheduling mechanisms a processor uses, and watch out for things like starvation.\n",

    "### Other thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "- we could consider dynamic areas, instead of static ones (say a circle with radius d around the courier)\n",
    "\n",
    "- or we could choose better areas, after we collect some data on which areas have more orders\n",
    "\n",
    "- maybe we should calculate the best courier for a given order based upon where that courier will be after the delivery of the last order in his/her queue\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider cases when it's best for the courier not to pickup/deliver orders sequentially\n",
