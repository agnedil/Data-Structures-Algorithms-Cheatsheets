# Python-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Personal Jupyter notebooks written while reading through the book "Python Data Structures and Algorithms" by Benjamin Baka.

## Background
### About the Book
"Python Data Structures and Algorithms", written by Benjamin Baka, is one of the books I'm currently reading. It gives an overview of the essential Python built-in data structures first, and then proceeds to use them as tools to build other common data structures and algorithms. All implementations are in Python, with line by line explanations.  
### About this Repository
The purpose of this repository is twofold. Firstly, I need to gain more knowledge about certain algorithms and a refresher on some of the data structures. This book serves the purpose perfectly, as I found its contents to be consise and insightful. <br><br>
Secondly, I decided to use this opportunity to learn and utilize Jupyter NoteBook at the same time. Jupyter is a third-party Python library which allows Python source code and Markdown to appear in the same file. Any Python code in a Jupyter Notebook can be run block by block in a browser, with intermidiate results or progress immdiately shown, and the support for Markdown can be used to write done notes. It's a very popular tool within Machine Learning community (By the way, I have been working full time on a Deep Learning Project for the last few months), and I found it to be an excellent tool for learning. <br><br>
